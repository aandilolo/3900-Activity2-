             My hobbies include sports, reading, all things computers, and many others! But those three I mentioned
             I consider my main ones. I have played sports all my life, and sports have inspired me to be
             motivated and diligent in whatever I do. My favorite sport is soccer, with Manchester United FC as my favorite
             professional soccer club. I also enjoy reading as a past-time to kick back and relax. I enjoy sci-fi books
             and autobiographies of notable people that I look up to. I also have been very intrigued with computers since a young
             age. The endless possibilities to create with this technology is what have been my main motivation to pursue
             this field.
