              Hello!
              Andy here, I live in Omaha but have have hopped many places for a living. 
              Originally from Indonesia and moved to the states, specifically to Scottsdale, 
              Arizona where I spent my High School years. I have had a short lived collegiate 
              football experience, playing for Arizona State until I tore my ACL during preseason. 
              Now here I am in UNO majoring in MIS (Management Information Systems) and this year is my third year. 
              I am passionate about all things sports as well as innovative technology! 
              I believe that data is the commodity of the future and will be imperative in driving our world to new heights.
              I am excited for what this class has to come!
            </p>
